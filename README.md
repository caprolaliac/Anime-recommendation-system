# Anime-recommendation-system

This project creates an Anime Recommendation System that provides personalised anime suggestions to users by utilising collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches. The system is constructed with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn packages, and it makes accurate and relevant recommendations by leveraging user rating data and anime metadata.

# Project-Overview

To provide reliable and diverse anime suggestions, the Anime Recommendation System combines collaborative filtering, which determines user preferences based on similar users, and content-based filtering, which analyses anime attributes such as genre and popularity. The following are the primary components of the project:

# Getting-Started

**Clone the repository:**  'git clone https://github.com/caprolaliac/Anime-recommendation-system.git' <br />

**Install the required libraries:** 'pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn' <br />

**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**  'jupyter notebook ANIME%20RECOMMENDATION%20system.ipynb' <br />

# Future-Enhancements

**Hybrid Approach:** Combining collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms for even more reliable recommendations. <br />

**Deploy as Web App:** Developing an easy-to-use online application that allows users to enter their preferences to gain anime recommendations. <br />

**Personalized Recommendations:** Improving system personalisation by incorporating user-specific data, such as viewing history. <br />
